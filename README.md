# sidebar-exp #
An experimental, tiny mod for CDDA. It adds another widget for the sidebar which combines Location and Vehicle speed in a single line.  
To install - download the folder and put it inside data\mods in your game.  
Then use it in a new World, or manually edit your save game's mod.json file to add it.
